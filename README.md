# Simple-Inventory📦📱
A smart tool for managing a product inventory record purchased inventory, manage suppliers, view available stock, record sales, view analytics. It uses a bunch of a off-the-shelf software; the result is something that:

1. is better than using a spreadsheet;
2. is a lot less confusing than building/maintaining an something like an MS Access database;
3. provides consistency and promise.

I built this for a relative's small medical practice, which needed to replace an old Microsoft Works database. The functionality here is decidedly built-to-purpose, supporting existing, largely paper-based workflows.
